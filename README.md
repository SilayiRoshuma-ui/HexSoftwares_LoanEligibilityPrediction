# Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Internship Program
HexSoftwares – Data Science Internship

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using a supervised
machine learning classification model. The goal is to determine whether
a loan should be approved or not based on applicant financial attributes.

## Dataset
A structured loan dataset was created to simulate real-world loan
applications. The dataset includes income, credit score, employment
years, loan amount, and loan approval status.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression

## Steps Performed
1. Data creation and understanding
2. Data exploration and validation
3. Feature selection
4. Train-test split
5. Model training using Logistic Regression
6. Model evaluation using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and
   classification report

## Results
The model successfully predicts loan eligibility with good accuracy,
demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for binary
classification problems.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened practical knowledge of classification models,
data preprocessing, and performance evaluation in data science.
